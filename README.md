# Uncommon Java Bug: ArithmeticException

This repository demonstrates a less frequently encountered bug in Java: the `ArithmeticException`. This exception, unlike the more common `NullPointerException`, arises from attempting to divide by zero.  The code within `UncommonBug.java` showcases this.  The solution, provided in `UncommonBugSolution.java`, implements robust error handling to prevent the program from crashing.

This example is valuable for understanding less common but still potentially disruptive exceptions in Java programming.  The solution highlights the importance of defensive programming and proper exception handling.
